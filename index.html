    <div><h2>Welcome to my portfolio-page!
        My name is Monika and I am a portrait photographer
        with 15 years experience,
         junior UI-designer & junior front-end developer,
        Based in Larvik, Norway.
        
        I love creating, photographing, designing,
        Colors, fonts & websites,
        Buttons, transforms & animations,
        &
        My skills include Photoshop, Illustrator,
        Adobe XD, HTML5, CSS, Javascript,
        React, Bootstrap, Headless Wordpress,
        PHP, SEO, Content marketing,
        And the image here is showcasing my photography skills,
        Not my face by the way.</h2></div>

        <h3>About me</h3>
        <div>
            <p>I am one of those who spent a lot of time of their life wondering 
                What was my purpose in life. I therefor have done many different 
                Things, some that I was quite good at, some donâ€™t.
                
                I finally started seeing my path in my mid twenties, but it was still
                Some years left before it was clear to me that I was a creator.
                
                Some of my strengths that I am very thankful that I have is that
                I am not the one to give up, I keep on going until I find a solution.
                 I also like the fact that I care for others, and I love people(
                With some exceptions of course. Not so found of Putin and
                Trump among others.)
                
                I am curious and try to learn something new everyday,
                And I also enjoy yoga, music and dancing, and of course the
                Most important of all, my heart and sunshine, my son Oliver.</p>
